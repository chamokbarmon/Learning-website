         <p>Why you should make an FAQ page ?</p>
         <p>Ans : An FAQ page is a time-saving customer service tactic that provides the most commonly asked questions and answers for current or potential customers. 
         Before diving into how to make an FAQ page, you need to know why having one is so important. There are so many reasons beyond improving the customer experience for perfecting your FAQ page. Keep in mind the importance of an FAQ page when developing your own e-commerce website so you can make sure it increases sales and not the other way around.</p>

         <p>Saves time  ?</p>
         <p>Ans : This reason might be the most obvious, but it’s a clear benefit of an FAQ page. Not only does the FAQ page save customers time, but it also saves employees time as well. Having an FAQ page ensures customers dont have to sit on the phone for hours waiting for simple answers and employees don’t have to individually answer all questions. 
         Companies dedicate a large portion of their budgets to customer service teams. When these teams dont have to focus on answering the frequently asked questions, they can serve other customer issues in a more timely manner</p>

         <p>Earns trust </p>
         <p>Information is available at the click of a button, but as we all know, information is not always true. Because of this, customers are more skeptical than ever before. They hunt for products by sifting through reviews, looking at the product on multiple websites, and doing price checking across the internet. 

       If your brand seems to understand the customers pain point and address it through a seamless user experience, the shopper will become a loyal customer. </p>
